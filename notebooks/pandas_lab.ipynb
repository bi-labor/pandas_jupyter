    "Before completing this notebook, you should read the introductory material which is available in you Github Classroom repository or [here](https://github.com/bi-labor/pandas_jupyter/blob/master/notebooks/Pandas_introduction.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems are numbered from **Q1** to **Q5** with many subproblems such as **Q1.1**. The scores range from 2 to 5 based on the difficulty of the problem. The maximum score for each Task is:\n",

    "Task 5 contains advanced exercises for higher scores.\n",
    "You can make up for mistakes in Task 1-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer should go in place of `YOUR CODE HERE`. Please remove `raise NotImplementedError`.\n",
    "Most of the tasks are automatically graded with [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "There are many visible and hidden tests.\n",
    "Visible tests are available in this version, hidden tests are not.\n",
    "This means that passing all visible tests does not ensure that your answer is correct.\n",

    "\n",
    "You generally don't need to leave any DataFrames printed as cell outputs. You can do it for debug purposes and it won't affect the autograder but please don't leave long tables in the output. Use `.head()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be concise. All exercises can be solved with fewer than 5 lines of code and most are one-liners.\n",
    "\n",
    "All exercises can be solved without for loops. Using a for loop for Q1.6 is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid overriding Python built-in functions with your own variables (`max = 2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you mess up, you can always do one of the following\n",
    "  1. Kernel -> Restart & Run All - this will run all cells from top to bottom until an exception is thrown\n",
    "  1. Kernel -> Restart, Cell -> Run All Above - this will run all cells from top to bottom until the current cell is reached or and exception is thrown\n",
    "  \n",
    "If your notebook runs for longer than a minute, one or more of your solutions is very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Please fill out this [short survey](https://forms.gle/jb8D6uqVD3rp9piw8) after you completed the problems."
